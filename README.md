# DMX-Universe-Planner
A tool to plan all your DMX universes 

This tool allows you to put in data(dmx adrres, name, FID, amount of channels) from your fixtures and put it in a table. You can also export the table to a csv file. at the moment thr max amount if universes is 8 but there will be more in the future 

## Dependencies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PySimpleGui](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)

The tool only supports Windows, MacOs and Linux at the moment. I plan to also make it available on Android & IOS
